sndcrunch
=========

A simple audio bit crunching tool.

To Build
--------

You must first satisfy the dependencies. You need a C compiler, the GNU
Autotools, pkg-config, and libsndfile. On Debian-based systems, you can get
these like so:

    # apt-get install build-essential automake autoconf pkg-config
    # apt-get install libsndfile1-dev

You also need Delwink's
[libpfxtree](http://delwink.com/software/libpfxtree.html). Follow its
instructions for installation.

sndcrunch uses the GNU build process:

    $ ./autogen.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make

To Install
----------

After building (see above):

    # make install

Using sndcrunch
---------------

The most basic usage is an input and output file:

    $ sndcrunch infile.wav outfile.wav

The formats supported by sndcrunch are:

- AIFF with the extensions aif and aiff
- AU with the extensions au and snd
- CAF with the extension caf
- FLAC with the extension flac
- Ogg Vorbis with the extension ogg
- WAV with the extensions wav and wave
- XI with the extension xi

The trickiest part of using sndcrunch is setting the right loss level. It can
be set using the `-l` or `--loss` options as so:

    $ sndcrunch --loss 5 infile.flac outfile.ogg

Each sound input seems to have its own "sweet spot" where the output is most
ideal. A loss level too high produces unpleasant noise, and a loss level too
low just makes a scratchy version of the original. The default loss level is 10
which seems to be a decent level for human speech sounds, which is the original
purpose of this program.

The minimum loss level of 1 would actually leave the input unaltered. Since any
combination of the input and output extensions is allowed, you could actually
use sndcrunch as a simple audio converter if you wanted, but it only outputs
16-bit audio, so it would not be the ideal transcoder.

For more information on sndcrunch's CLI, use `--help`.

Hacking
-------

sndcrunch uses the GNU coding style for C with a strict 79-column limit in the
source code. Indentations are two spaces, and tab characters are eight
spaces. It is polite to use a tab character any time eight spaces would be used
in an indentation, but it is not required.
